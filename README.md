# ghostty

[Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty) is a terminal emulator written by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://github.com/mitchellh). It's currently in private beta, but you can join the Discord and get in on the fun.

## Usage

The `config` file here contains the options for setting your window, cursor, and terminal colors based on the Electron Highlighter theme.

You should be able to copy and paste this into your Ghostty config (probably at `~/.config/ghostty/config`), reload the terminal, and see your new theme.

Enjoy! :heart:
